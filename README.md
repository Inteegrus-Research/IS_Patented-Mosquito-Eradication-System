# 🦟 Mosquito Eradication Model – Patent Project

This repository documents our **patent-filed mosquito eradication system**, designed to provide a sustainable and highly effective solution to control mosquito populations and reduce mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Zika virus.

---

## 📌 Abstract
The invention combines **multiple mosquito-attraction methods** (UV light, CO₂-based biochemical paste, and odor mimics) with a **high-voltage electrified grid** powered by a rechargeable Li-ion battery. The system integrates:
- 365nm UV light
- CO₂ + volatile compound releasing paste
- High-voltage zapper grid (3–10kV)
- Solar + external charging support

---

## ⚡ Circuitry
- Powered by **12V Li-ion battery**
- **Commercial mosquito zapper circuit** base, optimized with safety features
- **Flyback transformer** generates 3–10kV
- **Electrified mesh grid** spaced ≤2mm
- **Fuse & casing** for safety

## 🧪 Paste Formulation
The **biochemical attractant paste** mimics human sweat & breath:
- Controlled **CO₂ release** (yeast fermentation + CaO + KMnO₄ oxidation)
- **Lactic acid & Octenol** for sweat/breath mimicry
- **Protein odor (casein/blood meal)** for attraction

Preparation steps → [paste/Preparation_Method.md](paste/Preparation_Method.md)

---

## 📊 Results
- Significant mosquito attraction via **CO₂ + UV light synergy**
- Effective mosquito elimination by the **electrified grid**
- Practical, safe, and scalable for **urban & rural deployment**

---

## 🌍 Impact
- **Health:** Reduces mosquito-borne diseases
- **Environment:** Chemical-free, eco-friendly
- **Society:** Low-cost, sustainable, scalable
